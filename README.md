[![Build Status](https://drone.rdflib.ashs.dev/api/badges/RDFLib/pySHACL/status.svg)](https://drone.rdflib.ashs.dev/RDFLib/pySHACL)

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/147505799.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/147505799) [![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/pyshacl)](https://pepy.tech/project/pyshacl) [![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/pyshacl/month)](https://pepy.tech/project/pyshacl/month) [![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/pyshacl/week)](https://pepy.tech/project/pyshacl/week)

This is a pure Python module which allows for the validation of [RDF](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/RDF) graphs against Shapes Constraint Language ([SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/)) graphs. This module uses the [rdflib](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib) Python library for working with RDF and is dependent on the [OWL-RL](https://github.com/RDFLib/OWL-RL) Python module for [OWL2 RL Profile](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/#ref-owl-2-profiles) based expansion of data graphs.

This module is developed to adhere to the SHACL Recommendation:
> Holger Knublauch; Dimitris Kontokostas. *Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL)*. 20 July 2017. W3C Recommendation. URL: <https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/> ED: <https://w3c.github.io/data-shapes/shacl/>

# Community for Help and Support
The SHACL community has a discord server for discussion of topics around SHACL and the SHACL specification.

[Use this invitation link: https://discord.gg/RTbGfJqdKB to join the server](https://discord.gg/RTbGfJqdKB)

There is a \#pyshacl channel for discussion of this python library, and you can ask for general SHACL help too.

## Installation
Install with PIP (Using the Python3 pip installer `pip3`)
```bash
$ pip3 install pyshacl
```

Or in a python virtualenv _(these example commandline instructions are for a Linux/Unix based OS)_
```bash
$ python3 -m virtualenv --python=python3 --no-site-packages .venv
$ source ./.venv/bin/activate
$ pip3 install pyshacl
```

To exit the virtual enviornment:
```bash
$ deactivate
```

## Command Line Use
For command line use:
_(these example commandline instructions are for a Linux/Unix based OS)_
```bash
$ pyshacl -s /path/to/shapesGraph.ttl -m -i rdfs -a -j -f human /path/to/dataGraph.ttl
```
Where
 - `-s` is an (optional) path to the shapes graph to use
 - `-e` is an (optional) path to an extra ontology graph to import
 - `-i` is the pre-inferencing option
 - `-f` is the ValidationReport output format (`human` = human-readable validation report)
 - `-m` enable the meta-shacl feature
 - `-a` enable SHACL Advanced Features
 - `-j` enable SHACL-JS Features (if `pyhsacl[js]` is installed)

System exit codes are:
`0` = DataGraph is Conformant
`1` = DataGraph is Non-Conformant
`2` = The validator encountered a RuntimeError (check stderr output for details)
`3` = Not-Implemented; The validator encountered a SHACL feature that is not yet implemented.

## Python Module Use
For basic use of this module, you can just call the `validate` function of the `pyshacl` module like this:

```python
from pyshacl import validate
r = validate(data_graph,
      shacl_graph=sg,
      ont_graph=og,
      inference='rdfs',
      abort_on_first=False,
      allow_infos=False,
      allow_warnings=False,
      meta_shacl=False,
      advanced=False,
      js=False,
      debug=False)
conforms, results_graph, results_text = r
```

Where:
* `data_graph` is an rdflib `Graph` object or file path of the graph to be validated
* `shacl_graph` is an rdflib `Graph` object or file path or Web URL of the graph containing the SHACL shapes to validate with, or None if the SHACL shapes are included in the data_graph.
* `ont_graph` is an rdflib `Graph` object or file path or Web URL a graph containing extra ontological information, or None if not required. RDFS and OWL definitions from this are used to inoculate the DataGraph.
* `inference` is a Python string value to indicate whether or not to perform OWL inferencing expansion of the `data_graph` before validation.
Options are 'rdfs', 'owlrl', 'both', or 'none'. The default is 'none'.
* `abort_on_first` (optional) `bool` value to indicate whether or not the program should abort after encountering the first validation failure or to continue. Default is to continue.
* `allow_infos` (optional) `bool` value, Shapes marked with severity of Info will not cause result to be invalid.
* `allow_warnings` (optional) `bool` value, Shapes marked with severity of Warning or Info will not cause result to be invalid.
* `meta_shacl` (optional) `bool` value to indicate whether or not the program should enable the Meta-SHACL feature. Default is False.
* `advanced`: (optional) `bool` value to enable SHACL Advanced Features
* `js`: (optional) `bool` value to enable SHACL-JS Features (if `pyshacl[js]` is installed)
* `debug` (optional) `bool` value to indicate whether or not the program should emit debugging output text, including violations that didn't lead to non-conformance overall. So when debug is True don't judge conformance by absense of violation messages. Default is False.

Some other optional keyword variables available on the `validate` function:
* `data_graph_format`: Override the format detection for the given data graph source file.
* `shacl_graph_format`: Override the format detection for the given shacl graph source file.
* `ont_graph_format`: Override the format detection for the given extra ontology graph source file.
* `iterate_rules`: Iterate SHACL Rules until steady state is found (only works with advanced mode).
* `do_owl_imports`: Enable the feature to allow the import of subgraphs using `owl:imports` for the shapes graph and the ontology graph. Note, you explicitly cannot use this on the target data graph.
* `serialize_report_graph`: Convert the report results_graph into a serialised representation (for example, 'turtle')
* `check_dash_result`: Check the validation result against the given expected DASH test suite result.
* `check_sht_result`: Check the validation result against the given expected SHT test suite result.

Return value:
* a three-component `tuple` containing:
  * `conforms`: a `bool`, indicating whether or not the `data_graph` conforms to the `shacl_graph`
  * `results_graph`: a `Graph` object built according to the SHACL specification's [Validation Report](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#validation-report) structure
  * `results_text`: python string representing a verbose textual representation of the [Validation Report](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#validation-report)


## Python Module Call

You can get an equivalent of the Command Line Tool using the Python3 executable by doing:

```bash
$ python3 -m pyshacl
```

## Integrated OpenAPI-3.0-compatible HTTP REST Service

PySHACL now has a built-in validation service, exposed via an OpenAPI3.0-compatible REST API.

Due to the additional dependencies required to run, this feature is an optional extra.

You must first install PySHACL with the `http` extra option enabled:

```bash
$ pip3 install -U pyshacl[http]
```

When that is installed, you can start the service using the by executing the CLI entrypoint:

```bash
$ pyshacl --server
# or
$ pyshacl_server
# or
$ python3 -m pyshacl server
# or
$ docker run --rm -e PYSHACL_SERVER=TRUE -i -t docker.io/ashleysommer/pyshacl:latest
```

By default, this will run the service on localhost address `127.0.0.1` on port `8099`.

To view the SwaggerUI documentation for the service, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8099/docs/swagger` and for the ReDoc version, go to `http://127.0.0.1:8099/docs/redoc`.

To view the OpenAPI3 schema see `http://127.0.0.1:8099/docs/openapi.json`

### Configuring the HTTP REST Service

- You can force PySHACL CLI to start up in HTTP Server mode by passing environment variable `PYSHACL_SERVER=TRUE`. This is useful in a containerised service, where you will _only_ be running PySHACL in this mode.
- `PYSHACL_SERVER_LISTEN=1.2.3.4` listen on a different IP Address or hostname
- `PYSHACL_SERVER_PORT=8080` listen on given different TCP PORT
- `PYSHACL_SERVER_HOSTNAME=example.org` when you are hosting the server behind a reverse-proxy or in a containerised environment, use this so PySHACL server knows what your externally facing hostname is



## Errors
Under certain circumstances pySHACL can produce a `Validation Failure`. This is a formal error defined by the SHACL specification and is required to be produced as a result of specific conditions within the SHACL graph.
If the validator produces a `Validation Failure`, the `results_graph` variable returned by the `validate()` function will be an instance of `ValidationFailure`.
See the `message` attribute on that instance to get more information about the validation failure.

Other errors the validator can generate:
- `ShapeLoadError`: This error is thrown when a SHACL Shape in the SHACL graph is in an invalid state and cannot be loaded into the validation engine.
- `ConstraintLoadError`: This error is thrown when a SHACL Constraint Component is in an invalid state and cannot be loaded into the validation engine.
- `ReportableRuntimeError`: An error occurred for a different reason, and the reason should be communicated back to the user of the validator.
- `RuntimeError`: The validator encountered a situation that caused it to throw an error, but the reason does concern the user.

Unlike `ValidationFailure`, these errors are not passed back as a result by the `validate()` function, but thrown as exceptions by the validation engine and must be
caught in a `try ... except` block.
In the case of `ShapeLoadError` and `ConstraintLoadError`, see the `str()` string representation of the exception instance for the error message along with a link to the relevant section in the SHACL spec document.


## Windows CLI

[Pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) can be
[used](https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html) to create an
executable for Windows that has the same characteristics as the Linux/Mac
CLI program.
The necessary ``.spec`` file is already included in ``pyshacl/pyshacl-cli.spec``.
The ``pyshacl-cli.spec`` PyInstaller spec file creates a ``.exe`` for the
pySHACL Command Line utility. See above for the pySHACL command line util usage instructions.

See [the PyInstaller installation guide](https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#installing-in-windows) for info on how to install PyInstaller for Windows.

Once you have pyinstaller, use pyinstaller to generate the ``pyshacl.exe`` CLI file like so:
```bash powershell
$ cd src/pyshacl
$ pyinstaller pyshacl-cli.spec
```
This will output ``pyshacl.exe`` in the ``dist`` directory in ``src/pyshacl``.

You can now run the pySHACL Command Line utility via ``pyshacl.exe``.
See above for the pySHACL command line util usage instructions.

## Docker
Pull out the official docker image from Dockerhub:
`docker pull docker.io/ashleysommer/pyshacl:latest`

Or build the image yourself, from the PySHACL repository with `docker build . -t pyshacl`.

You can now run PySHACL inside a container; but you need to mount the data you want to validate.
For example, to validate `graph.ttl` against `shacl.ttl`, run :
```bash
docker run --rm -i -t --mount type=bind,src=`pwd`,dst=/data pyshacl -s /data/shacl.ttl /data/graph.ttl
```

## Compatibility
PySHACL is a Python3 library. For best compatibility use Python v3.7 or greater. Python3 v3.6 or below is _**not supported**_ and this library _**does not work**_ on Python v2.7.x or below.

PySHACL is now a PEP518 & PEP517 project, it uses `pyproject.toml` and `poetry` to manage dependencies, build and install.

For best compatibility when installing from PyPI with `pip`, upgrade to pip v18.1.0 or above.
  - If you're on Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04, you will need to run `sudo pip3 install --upgrade pip` to get the newer version.
